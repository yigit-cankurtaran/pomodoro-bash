# Pomodoro in Bash

- Bash script to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in a Unix terminal.
    - Originally wrote it for Linux, later switched to Mac.
    - Can still be used for Linux, just change the afplay command to aplay.
- Intentionally did not add any functionality to skip Pomodoros or breaks.
- Currently finished, will be used by me often.
