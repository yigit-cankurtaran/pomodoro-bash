# Pomodoro in Bash

- Bash script to use the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) in the Linux terminal.
    - Can be used for MacOS terminal also, just need to change the aplay command into afplay.
- Intentionally did not add any functionality to skip Pomodoros or breaks.
- Currently finished, will be used by me often.
